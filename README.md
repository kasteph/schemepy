schemepy
========

A toy Scheme interpreter written in Python. With guidance from Peter Norvig's
[lispy tutorial](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) and Mary Rose Cook's
[Little Lisp Interpreter](https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/21-little-lisp-interpreter).


what it does
--------
It evaluates:
* `if` statements
* `lambda` and `lambda` expressions
* some simple math
 
it can also `define` a variable and evaluate its expression if it has any.

what it doesn't do
--------
`set!`, `begin`, `proc`

todo
--------
* Implement the stuff in the what it doesn't do section
* Definitely refactor
* Write better tests
